                            I am a senior in the International Baccalaureate program at John Randolph Tucker High School in Henrico, Virginia. I enjoy playing basketball, spending time with my family, and helping my community. Having lawn mowed my parents' and grandparentsâ€™ yards since a young age, I enjoy providing my extensive landscaping services to those in my community as well.

                                    High School. Ever since I was young, I have been doing landscaping work for my family, which is what 
                                    inspired me to co-found Clean Green. My favorite part about the work we do is getting to help members 
                                    of our community serious issues and restore the beauty of their homes.

                                    High School. Each time I mowed and edged my parents' and neighbors' lawns, I always felt satisfied by the process 
                                    of bettering my commnunity. Therfore, I decided to embark on this journey with my friends to expand on our joy 
                                    of helping others restore pride in their lawns.
