                        I am a senior in the International Baccalaureate program at John Randolph Tucker High School in Henrico, Virginia. I enjoy playing basketball, spending time with my family, and helping my community. Having lawn mowed my parents' and grandparentsâ€™ yards since a young age, I enjoy providing my extensive landscaping services to those in my community as well.
